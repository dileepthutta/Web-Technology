  <h1>Secrets of the Stylish Star: Allu Arjun</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Allu Arjun doesn’t walk into a room. He stylishly enters with background music and imaginary wind blowing his hair.</li>
    <li>He doesn't follow fashion trends. Fashion trends wait to see what he's wearing.</li>
    <li>Every time he dances, gravity files a complaint. Even physics can’t keep up with his moves.</li>
    <li>He once said "Pushpa, I hate tears" and even Pushpa stopped crying. That’s the power of dialogue delivery.</li>
    <li>Allu Arjun fans don’t say “hello.” They greet each other with a slow-motion step and finger snap.</li>
    <li>If style was a superpower, Allu Arjun would be the Avengers, Justice League, and Rajinikanth combined.</li>
  </ul>
